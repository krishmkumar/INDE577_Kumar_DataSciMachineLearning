# Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the `rice2025` machine learning package.
All tests are written using `pytest` and validate core functionality, correctness,
and basic edge cases for each algorithm.

## Organization

Test files are named to correspond directly to their implementation modules
(e.g., `test_pca.py`, `test_logistic_regression.py`).

## Design Notes

- Tests use small synthetic datasets for clarity and speed.
- Randomness is controlled where applicable.
- Tests focus on expected behavior rather than performance benchmarking.

## Running Tests

From the project root:

```bash
pytest
```
